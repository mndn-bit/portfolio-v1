I am Kazuto Nishio, a high school student in Japan. I was born and raised in Japan. Since the age of 10, I have been actively involved in a wide range of fields, including programming, server infrastructure, business, and marketing.

I have a home setup equipped with infrastructure such as rack servers, switching hubs, and firewalls. Using these machines, I develop various services and solutions.
